You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python\rimport pandas as pd\rdata = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;)\rdata.head()\r```\rrenders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;}\r- Hugo Modules\r- wowchemy\r- wowchemy-plugins-netlify\r- wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms\r- wowchemy-plugins-reveal\r```\rrenders as\n- Hugo Modules\r- wowchemy\r- wowchemy-plugins-netlify\r- wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms\r- wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap\r- Mindmaps\r- Links\r- [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/)\r- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)\r- [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes)\r- Features\r- Markdown formatting\r- **inline** ~~text~~ *styles*\r- multiline\rtext\r- `inline code`\r-\r```js\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;);\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;);\r```\r- Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$\r```\rrenders as\n- Mindmaps\r- Links\r- [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/)\r- [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb)\r- [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes)\r- Features\r- Markdown formatting\r- **inline** ~~text~~ *styles*\r- multiline\rtext\r- `inline code`\r-\r```js\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;);\rconsole.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;);\r```\r- Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$\rExample inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\rf(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\r1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}\r$$\rDiagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid\rgraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]\r```\rrenders as\ngraph TD\rA[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round)\rB --\u0026gt; C{Decision}\rC --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1]\rC --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid\rsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!\r```\rrenders as\nsequenceDiagram\rAlice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughts!\rJohn--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great!\rJohn-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you?\rBob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good!
