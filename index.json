In this article, I am going to discuss the dynamics of one such device. The cart would be constrained to move only along a s straight line such that it lies in the pendulum’s plane of motion. This is illustrated in the cover picture.\nThe dynamics would be described by a set of differential equations and these equations would be derived using two formulations of mechanics: Lagrangian dynamics and Hamiltonian dynamics. I omit deriving these equations using Newton’s second law because it is very tedious and increasing the chances of mistakes sneaking in. Along with theory, a jupyter notebook would be provided with necessary code to derive these equations symbolically in python link.\nSystem setup The static configuration of the system is defined by two variables; $x$ the position of the cart relative to a reference and $\\theta$ the angle between the pendulum and the vertical axis ($y$-axis) . Unlike a regular pendulum, the angle $\\theta$ is measured from the positive $y$-axis. In a later article, we will discuss how to stabilises the vertical upright position of the pendulum, so defining this position as zero would become convinient. The system setup is represented concisely in the following image.\rFig.1: System setup.\nThe system is this case is simplified. We assume the system experiences no friction or air drag. Additionally the pendulum is assumted to be point mass $m_p$ attached to a mass less rod of length $l$. The pendulum is attached the cart of mass $m_c$.\rVerification Before we go any further, we need to device some tests to verify whether the model we get represents the cart pendulum. It is always wise to have ways to test the answer before we get it. Doing this step beforehand ensures we are not biased by the answers. The following tests may not necessarily prove the correctness of the answer, but serves to indicate whether the solution is wrong. In other words, if the solution fails these tests, then the solution is wrong.\nTest 1 When the mass of the pendulum is very small compared to the cart, or when $m_p \\ll m_c \\rightarrow m_p / m_c \\approx 0$, we should be able to recover the dynamics of a simple pendulum\nTest 2 In this system, the cart-pendulum experiences no horizontal force, unless a control force acts on it. In this article, the control input is 0. So the horizontal position of the centre of mass of the system should remain at rest or uniform motion. Lagrangian Mechanics Lagrangian Mechanics is a formulation of mechanics which uses the principle of least action [1]. Action is defined in terms of a quantity called the lagrangian (represented using $L$). The Lagrangian $L$ is defined as $L = T - V$ where $T$ is the kinetic energy of the system and $V$ is the potential energy of the system. Please visit [2] for a deep discussion on the Lagrangian Formalism.\nSetting up the Lagrangian The quantities $L$, $T$ and $V$ are functions of the generalised states (the generalised positions $\\textbf{q}$ and velocities $\\dot{\\textbf{q}}$) and time $t$. In our case the generalised positions are $x$ and $\\theta$, while the generalised velocities are $\\dot{x}$ and $\\dot{\\theta}$. Let use now express these quantities in terms of the state variables.\nPosition of the cart $(x,0)$ Velocity of the cart $(\\dot{x}, 0)$ Kinetic energy of the cart $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2$ Potential energy of the cart 0\nPosition of the pendulum $(x + l\\sin(\\theta), l\\cos(\\theta))$\nVelocity of the pendulum $(\\dot{x} + \\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta), -\\dot{\\theta}l\\sin(\\theta))$\nKinetic energy of the pendulum $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_p((\\dot{x} + \\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta))^2 + (-\\dot{\\theta}l\\sin(\\theta)^2))$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2)$\nPotential energy of the pendulum $-m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$\nTotal kinetic energy, $T$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2 + \\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2)$\nTotal potential energy, $V$ $-m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$ The Lagrangian, $L$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2 + \\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2) + m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$\nDynamical equations The dynamical equations are derived using the Euler–Lagrange equation [1]. It is shown below\n$\\begin{equation}\r\\cfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\left(\\cfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_j}\\right) - \\cfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_j} = Q_{nc}\r\\end{equation}$\rHere $Q_{nc}$ represents and non-conservative force acting on the system, $q_j$ represents a single generalised position and $\\dot{q_j}$ the corresponding velocity. The non non-conservative could be a control input.

In this cart, we will use an alternate formulation called Hamiltonian mechanics to derive the dynamical equations. Although the resulting equations may not be same, rest assured it describes the same dynamics. The code used to derive these equations are hosted here.\nSystem setup This article follows the same convention for defining the static configuration of the system. It is defined by two variables; $x$ the position of the cart relative to a reference and $\\theta$ the angle between the pendulum and the vertical axis ($y$-axis) . Unlike a regular pendulum, the angle $\\theta$ is measured from the positive $y$-axis. The system setup is represented concisely in the following image.\rFig.1: System setup.\nThe system is this case is simplified. We assume the system experiences no friction or air drag. Additionally the pendulum is assumted to be point mass $m_p$ attached to a mass less rod of length $l$. The pendulum is attached the cart of mass $m_c$.\rHamiltonian Mechanics Hamiltonian mechanics is an alternate formulation of mechanics based on Lagrangian mechanics[1]. It replaces the generalised veolcity with the generalised momentum in the governing equations. Interestingly, it bridges classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. [2] is an excellent lecture on Hamiltonian mechanics. Please note may not necessarily be equal to the mechanical momentum $p=mv$ in a system. This was the first mistake I made, when I wrote the code.\nSetting up the Hamiltonian The quantities $L$, $T$ and $V$ are functions of the generalised states (the generalised positions $\\textbf{q}$ and velocities $\\dot{\\textbf{q}}$) and time $t$. Additionally, $\\textbf{p}$ represents the generalised momenta. To get the Hamiltonian, we perform a Legendre transformation on the Lnagrangian.\nThe differential of the Langrangian is given by the following\n$ dL = \\cfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}} d \\dot{q} + \\cfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} d q + \\cfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} d t $\nNow, compare $\\frac{dP}{dt}= F$ and $\\frac{d}{d t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q} + Q_n$. We see that the $P$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}$ occupy the same position. So we call $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}$ the generalised momentum $p$. Now, we want a quantity $H = H(q,p,t)$. This is where the Legendre transformation comes in and it is shown below.\n$\r\\begin{equation}\rH = \\textbf{p}\\dot{\\textbf{q}} - L\r\\tag{1}\r\\end{equation}\r$\rNote that we solve the equations $p = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}}$ to express $\\dot{q}$ in terms of $p$ and substitute in the equation (1), to express $H$ as a function of $q$ $p$ and $t$ alone. It will turn out that the Hamiltonian is the total energy of mechanical systems\nWe have to go through with this convoluted process because the generalised momenta need not be apparent and so it will not be possible to express the kinetic energy using $p$. These steps are illustrated for the cart pendulum below.\nPosition of the cart $(x,0)$ Velocity of the cart $(\\dot{x}, 0)$ Kinetic energy of the cart $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2$ Potential energy of the cart 0\nPosition of the pendulum $(x + l\\sin(\\theta), l\\cos(\\theta))$\nVelocity of the pendulum $(\\dot{x} + \\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta), -\\dot{\\theta}l\\sin(\\theta))$\nKinetic energy of the pendulum $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_p((\\dot{x} + \\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta))^2 + (-\\dot{\\theta}l\\sin(\\theta)^2))$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2)$\nPotential energy of the pendulum $-m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$\nTotal kinetic energy, $T$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2 + \\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2)$\nTotal potential energy, $V$ $-m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$ The Lagrangian, $L$ $\\cfrac{1}{2}m_c\\dot{x}^2 + \\cfrac{1}{2}m_p(\\dot{x}^2 + 2\\dot{x}\\dot{\\theta}l\\cos(\\theta) + (\\dot{\\theta}l)^2) + m_pgl\\cos(\\theta)$\nThe generalised momenta $\\begin{equation} p_1 = m_c \\ddot{x}+m_p\\left(-l \\sin (\\theta)\\left(\\dot{ \\theta}\\right)^2+l \\cos (\\theta) \\ddot{\\theta}+\\ddot{x}\\right) \\end{equation}$\n$ p_2 = m_pl\\left(l \\dot{\\theta} +\\cos \\left(\\theta\\right) \\dot{x} \\right) $\nYou can observe that $p_1$ is the momentum of the center of the mass along the $x$ axis while $p_2$ is the momentum along the $\\theta$ axis. Now these equations can be solved and substituted to get the Hamiltonian as shown below.\nThe Hamiltonian, $H$\n$ \\frac{g l^3 m_c m_p^2 \\cos \\left(\\theta\\right)+g l^3 m_p^3 \\sin ^2\\left(\\theta\\right) \\cos \\left(\\theta\\right)+\\frac{l^2 m_p \\mathrm{p}_1^2}{2}-l m_p \\mathrm{p}_1 \\mathrm{p}_2 \\cos \\left(\\theta\\right)+\\frac{m_c \\mathrm{p}_2^2}{2}+\\frac{m_p \\mathrm{p}_2^2}{2}}{l^2 m_p\\left(m_c+m_p \\sin ^2\\left(\\theta\\right)\\right)} $\nDynamical equations The dynamical equations are calculated using Hamilton’s equations.
